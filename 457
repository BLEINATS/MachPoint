          Security Hardening: Set search_path for handle_new_user_profile

          ## Query Description: [This operation enhances security by setting a fixed `search_path` for the `handle_new_user_profile` function. This prevents potential hijacking attacks by ensuring the function does not use a mutable search path. This change has no impact on existing data or application functionality and is a recommended security best practice.]
