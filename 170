/*
# [Function Security Hardening]
Set a secure search_path for the `secure_client_cancel_function` function.

## Query Description: 
This operation modifies the existing `secure_client_cancel_function` function to explicitly set the `search_path`. This is a security best practice that prevents potential hijacking of the function by malicious actors who could create objects in other schemas. This change does not alter the function's logic or behavior and has no impact on existing data.

## Metadata:
- Schema-Category: "Security"
- Impact-Level: "Low"
- Requires-Backup: false
- Reversible: true (by recreating the function without the `SET search_path` clause)

## Structure Details:
- Function being altered: `public.secure_client_cancel_function(uuid)`

## Security Implications:
- RLS Status: Not directly affected, but improves the security of functions used in RLS policies.
- Policy Changes: No
- Auth Requirements: None for this operation.

## Performance Impact:
- Indexes: None
- Triggers: None
- Estimated Impact: Negligible.
