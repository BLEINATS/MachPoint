/*
# [Fix] RLS for Credit Transactions and Refactor Cancellation Function
[This migration adds a Row-Level Security policy to the `credit_transactions` table, allowing users to insert their own credit records. It also refactors the reservation cancellation function to use `SECURITY INVOKER` for improved security and reliability, which should resolve the persistent "function not found" error.]

## Query Description: [This is a structural and security enhancement. It ensures that users can only manage credit transactions linked to their own profiles and makes the cancellation function more robust by running it with the caller's permissions. This is a safe operation.]

## Metadata:
- Schema-Category: ["Structural", "Security"]
- Impact-Level: ["Low"]
- Requires-Backup: false
- Reversible: false (requires manual reversal of policies and function)

## Structure Details:
- Table: `credit_transactions` (new RLS policy)
- Function: `client_cancel_booking_and_apply_credit` (dropped)
- Function: `cancel_reservation_and_get_credit` (created with `SECURITY INVOKER`)

## Security Implications:
- RLS Status: [Enabled] on `credit_transactions`
- Policy Changes: [Yes], new policy added.
- Auth Requirements: [User must be authenticated]

## Performance Impact:
- Indexes: [N/A]
- Triggers: [N/A]
- Estimated Impact: [Low]

-- Step 1: Enable RLS on the credit_transactions table if not already enabled.
-- It's safe to run this even if it's already enabled.
ALTER TABLE public.credit_transactions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Step 2: Drop any existing policy with the same name to avoid conflicts.
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow users to insert their own credit transactions" ON public.credit_transactions;

-- Step 3: Create a policy that allows a user to insert a credit transaction
-- if the 'aluno_id' of the transaction belongs to them.

-- Step 4: Drop the old function to ensure a clean slate.
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.client_cancel_booking_and_apply_credit(uuid);

-- Use SECURITY INVOKER: The function will run with the permissions of the user calling it.
