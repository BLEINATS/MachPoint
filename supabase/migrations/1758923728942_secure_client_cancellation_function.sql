/*
  # [SECURITY] Harden Client Cancellation Function
  This migration secures the `handle_client_cancellation_final` function by explicitly setting its `search_path`. This is a best practice recommended by Supabase to prevent potential search path hijacking vulnerabilities.

  ## Query Description: 
  This operation alters the existing `handle_client_cancellation_final` function to set its `search_path` configuration parameter to `public`. This ensures that any unqualified object names within the function resolve to the `public` schema, mitigating security risks without changing the function's logic. This is a safe, non-destructive operation.

  ## Metadata:
  - Schema-Category: "Safe"
  - Impact-Level: "Low"
  - Requires-Backup: false
  - Reversible: true (by altering the function to reset the search_path)

  ## Structure Details:
  - Function `public.handle_client_cancellation_final(uuid)` will be altered.

  ## Security Implications:
  - RLS Status: Unchanged
  - Policy Changes: No
  - Auth Requirements: Hardens the function against search path attacks.
  
  ## Performance Impact:
  - Indexes: None
  - Triggers: None
  - Estimated Impact: Negligible.
